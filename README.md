## About this Course

In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, I will study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning.

By the end, I will be familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to my own applications.

The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that will help me understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare me to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. It provides a pathway for me to gain the knowledge and skills to apply machine learning to my work, level up my technical career, and take the definitive step in the world of AI.
